I started learning Python on University and had no Idea that I loved programming so muh as I do untill I started to know more Python.

Things that helped me to love Python was to use VisualCode and the extensions that they have for Python. 
One you did the code on the VisualCode there is a button that you can click on the top right corner that will play your code step by step and if there is any
errors it will show step by step untill stucc or succeded.

This helped me to learn codding more and that is why I love Python so much. It helped me learn more about codding and helped me learn how odding works. I can tell you that 
in my preference 1000110101 is more difficult than working with Python and it would make sense because the odding that is used through Python is more user friendly than any other 
codding language.

How to make yourself count in the proffessional world. Something that I learned the hard way was to keep notes for each line of block. This helped me learn a lot more faster and
I would know where to return in the code if there was something wrong with the programming.

In this Record that I'm creating I will add some examples that I'learned through textbooks and experience on everyday.
