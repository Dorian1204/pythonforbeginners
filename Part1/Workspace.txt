In my personal Opinion is important that you know what you are doing and that you have a visual how your code is working. It is important to see your code run step by step and make a vailid evaluation
of what is going wrong with your code. I found that when I started exploring a new software to me that was called VisualStudioCode in this software I was able to install extentions that would make it
colorfull so I could read my code better but also I could test my programming a lot more easier through a arrow on the top right corner of the software. This will be my main go to when I work on Python.
Something else that VisualStudioCode has is the Problems/output/terminal/debugger that are located on the bottom of the visual studio code. Once you start to create your workplace and name the files to
PY then the VisualStudioCode wil recognize that you are working on Python and will make your life a lot more easier. VisualStudioCode is one of my got to where I can use more than one codding software.
